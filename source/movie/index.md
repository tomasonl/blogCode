## Discipline

Life can be brutal
Life can be unforgiving.
If i had to sum up in 1 word the difference between the greats and the average.
The difference between the successful and the nobodies of the world.
1 word.
1 attribute to describe the difference…

DISCIPLINE.
If you don’t have the discipline
You can forget about the trophy.
You can forget about the success, the greatness.
ALL CHAMPIONS HAVE DISCIPLINE.

It’s the discipline to work hard…
You know – NOT when everyone is watching.
But when no one is watching.
When the fans aren’t there.
When the coach isn’t there.
When it’s just you and your character.
The discipline to eat strong healthy foods, when you have other tempting options.
When those around you might not be so strong.

The discipline to say NO.
When those around you choose to be average.

The discipline to KEEP going WHEN IT HURTS.
Because LIFE doesn’t give you what you want.
It gives you what you deserve.
And if you haven’t worked for it.
If you haven’t sacrificed for it.
If you haven’t given your all.
Then – you don’t deserve it.
AND, you WON’T GET IT

Push through the pain.
On the other side is growth
When pain comes, that means it’s time to show character!
SHOW ME YOUR CHARACTER!
Remain disciplined.
STAY STRONG!

When it all seems hopeless:
Keep plugging away

Nothing can stop you if you don’t stop for anything
Don’t stop for anything!
Never break your discipline.
Remain faithful to yourself, and your vision.

When it get’s painful. PUSH HARDER.
PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN.
You gotta have the discipline to do 11, when your opponent stops at 10.

The discipline to KEEP going WHEN IT HURTS.
Because LIFE doesn’t give you what you want.
It gives you what you deserve.
And if you haven’t worked for it.
If you haven’t sacrificed for it.
If you haven’t given your all.
Then – you don’t deserve it. AND, you WON’T GET IT

SHOW YOUR CHARACTER!
Remain disciplined.
STAY STRONG!

Don’t say why the pain.
Don’t say WHY ME
Say TRY ME!
Say “Is that all you’ve got ?!”
Give me more!

don't say why me say try me
Keep plugging away, when there seems no hope of victory
When you don’t see the results

Hang in there.
Be strong. Be brave.
Remain DISCIPLINED
And your time will come.
